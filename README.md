# COBOL Training Code

This is sample code I used or did write myself for learning COBOL using GnuCOBOL, formerly known as OpenCOBOL. I learn COBOL using the book [http://www.apress.com/9781430262534 Beginning COBOL for programmers] from Michael Coughlan. You can find the excerices from Michael on the [https://github.com/Apress/beg-cobol-for-programmers Beginning COBOL For Programmers] repository here on GitHub. I also added some code I wrote myself. The Author section in the information division of the code states the original author.
