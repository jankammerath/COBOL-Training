# COBOL Training Code

This is sample code I used or did write myself for learning COBOL using GnuCOBOL, formerly known as OpenCOBOL. I learn COBOL using the book [Beginning COBOL for programmers](http://www.apress.com/9781430262534) from Michael Coughlan. You can find the excerices from Michael on the [Beginning COBOL For Programmers](https://github.com/Apress/beg-cobol-for-programmers) repository here on GitHub. I also added some code I wrote myself. The Author section in the information division of the code states the original author.

## Compiling with GnuCOBOL

I compile the code with GnuCOBOL and you can find the compilation instructions in the [make.sh](/COBOL-Training/blob/master/make.sh) file.
